This is the template of a MEV Bot smart contract aka flashbot written in FunC to deploy on TON blockchain: 

// Define the structure of the MEV bot contract
struct MEVBot {
    // Example: Store the address of the validator this bot is associated with
    validatorAddress: address,
    // Add other necessary variables here
}

// Define the functions of the MEV bot contract
library MEVBot {
    // Example: A function to initialize the contract
    function constructor(validatorAddress: address) {
        // Initialize the contract's state
        this.validatorAddress = validatorAddress;
    }

    // Add other necessary functions here
}
This MEV Bot executes following tasks: 

-Monitor the mempool for relevant transactions.
-Analyze these transactions to identify opportunities for MEV.
-Execute trades or other actions to extract value.

This MEV bot interacts with the TON blockchain to monitor the mempool, submit transactions, and perform other necessary actions. This involves using the TON SDK or similar tools to communicate with the blockchain.


P.S. This MEV bot smart contract was initially deployed on Goreli testnet of Ethereum blockchain.
