This is the template of a MEV Bot smart contract aka flashbot written in FunC to deploy on TON blockchain:

// Define the structure of the MEV bot contract
struct MEVBot {
    // Example: Store the address of the validator this bot is associated with
    validatorAddress: address,
    // Add other necessary variables here
}

// Define the functions of the MEV bot contract
library MEVBot {
    // Example: A function to initialize the contract
    function constructor(validatorAddress: address) {
        // Initialize the contract's state
        this.validatorAddress = validatorAddress;
    }

    // Example: A function to analyze transactions (this is highly simplified)
    function analyzeTransactions() {
        // Implement logic to analyze transactions in the mempool
        // This will depend on the specifics of the TON blockchain and its smart contract language
    }

    // Example: A function to execute a MEV strategy (this is highly simplified)
    function executeMEVStrategy() {
        // Implement logic to execute a MEV strategy based on the analysis
        // This will depend on the specifics of the TON blockchain and its smart contract language
    }
}


P.S. This MEV bot interacts with the TON blockchain to monitor the mempool, submit transactions, and perform other necessary actions. This involves using the TON SDK or similar tools to communicate with the blockchain.
